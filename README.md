FWI (Fire Weather Index) Prediction refers to forecasting the likelihood and intensity of forest fires based on weather conditions.

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a component of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System, which estimates fire danger based on factors like:

Temperature
Relative Humidity (RH)
Rainfall
Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)
Duff Moisture Code (DMC)
Initial Spread Index (ISI)
A higher FWI value indicates a greater risk of fire and faster fire spread. Your project predicts this index using machine learning models to help in early fire detection and prevention
